## üñ•Ô∏è CLI Usage

### Pre-Flop Odds

Let's say we want to know the odds for these 3 hands: J‚ô•J‚ô† vs T‚ô¶T‚ô† vs A‚ô£K‚ô£:

```bash
npx poker-odds-calculator JhJs TdTs AcKc
```

#### Post-Flop Odds

On a 7‚ô¶9‚ô¶T‚ô† board (with 2 cards to come), with two hands:

```bash
npx poker-odds-calculator -b 7d9dTs JhJs JdQd
npx poker-odds-calculator --board 7d9dTs7s JhJs JdQd
```
> -b denotes the board

#### Short Deck

To calculate odds using the short deck (6+) rules, override the game variant with -g/--game:

 ```bash
npx poker-odds-calculator -g short -b 7d9dTs JhJs JdQd
npx poker-odds-calculator --game short --board 7d9dTs7s JhJs JdQd
```

## üõ†Ô∏è API Usage

Calculate odds programmatically in TypeScript/Node:

```js
import {CardGroup, OddsCalculator} from 'poker-odds-calculator';

const player1Cards = CardGroup.fromString('JhJs');
const player2Cards = CardGroup.fromString('JdQd');
const board = CardGroup.fromString('7d9dTs');

const result = OddsCalculator.calculate([player1Cards, player2Cards], board);

console.log(`Player #1 - ${player1Cards} - ${result.equities[0].getEquity()}%`);
console.log(`Player #2 - ${player2Cards} - ${result.equities[1].getEquity()}%`);
```

For Short Deck odds:

```js
const result = OddsCalculator.calculate([player1Cards, player2Cards], board, 'short');
```
